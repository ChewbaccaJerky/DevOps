# Dev Ops - W1D5 - Puppet, Chef, and OpsWorks

# Fleet Management
    - Deployment to large fleet - Parallel
    
    ## Issues & Concerns
    - Downtime is always a concern, so speed is desired
    - We want all machines to be in a known state at all times
    - Deployment scripts are comprised of multiple steps
    - Failure of a single step can cause the machine to be in an unknown state
    - Failures can occur from:
        - Bugs in scripts
        - Network Issues
        - Version Locking Issues
        - Resource Inconsistencies
    - We can mitigate risks by:
        - Minimizing network distance
        - Automating as much as possible
        - Idempotency with rollback

    ## Other Concerns
        - Database Migration
         Load Balancing
         - A/B Testing
         - Push vs Pull
         - Multiple Servor roles with multiple environments

# Puppet vs Chef
    ## Puppet
        - Puppet scripts define the "final state" of the server
        - Each "step in the sripts mofulr 

    ## Chef
# Ansible vs SaltStack
    ## Ansible
    ## SaltStack
# Opsworks
    - AWS service
    - Uses client/server mdodel
    - USes custom server and custom client agent
    - Uses either puppet or chef scripts
    - Therefore uses puppet/chef in solo mode
    - Integrates with lifecycle of AWS CS2 Instances
    ## Opsworks Units
        ### Stacks
            - Group machines together based on shared resources
        ### Layers
            - Group machines together based on roles
            - Custom recipes per lifecycle event
        ### Apps
            - Deployable identifier, scripts can use app name
