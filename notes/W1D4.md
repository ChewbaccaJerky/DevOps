## RDS Overview
- RDS provides pre-configured instances of common relational databases
- Because many of the features of these databases are shared across all implementations, the UI provides controls for common features.

## Relational Databases
- Data is stored in tables
- Data stored in Disk
- Disk's records are contiguous similar to array. Primary key can indexed in at constant. O(1)
- Tables stored as rows and columns
- Underlying data-structure is typically a BST or Array(fixed fields)
- Queries (searching) is typically performed via SQL
- Able to relate different tables
- Able to provide different ways to "Key" the BST
- "Primary Key" 
    - typically disk represented
    - in the BST in the database
- Able to provide additional "indexes" to increase search speed
    ```
        Database data structures( Array and BST )
        Time Complexity:
            READ: O(logn) or worst case O(n)
            WRITE: O(logn)
    ```

- Creating indexes in psql
    ```
      create index <index name> on <table> (<indexed field>)
    ```
- When creating more indexes you're database needs to update two Array's

# Database Optimization
- How to optimize your database
- Adding indexes
- Use 'explain analyze' to check sql costs
```
    explain analyze <Complex SQL Query>
```


## Indexes
- Indexes tell the database to also represent the table in a secondary BST (or Hash), with keys only, values pointing to the original record. When querying, the database will try to use the best index available for optimal speed.
    - Primary Key Index
    - Foreign Key Index
    - Prefix Index
    - Full Text Index
    - Multi-column Index
- Indexes will increase lookup speed, but slow inserts/deletes

## Read Replica - Scaling
- Master/Slave model
- Master is read/write
- Slave is read only, used for large reads, also used for backups
- Master uses transaction log shipping to update slave
- Indexes can vary between master and slaves
- Single Poiont of truth - Sharding
    - Splitting database. Master can write, Slaves can only read.

## Backups ( Snapshots )
- All database implementations support some way to take a backup of the data
- AWS calls this feature "Snapshots"
- AWS helps you take snapshots and restore them through the UI
- You can also manually take backups in postgres:
    ```
        pg_dump --host=<host1> <dbname1> > latest.dump
        pg_restore --host=<host2> --dbname=<dbname2> lastest.dump
    ```

# ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
## Atomicity
- Every request will either succeed or fail
