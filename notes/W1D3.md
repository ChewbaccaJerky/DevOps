# W1D3 - Continuous Integration

## Continuous Integration
- Gets triggered by source code commits
- Runs any tests for frontend or backend code
- Builds any artifacts(production js files, rails assets)
- Publishes the artifacts (test results to dashboard, or assets to S3)
- Triggers a deploy ( in Opsworks )
- Many CI systems are configured by a config file in the source code repo
- Can build multiple branches and ony deploy specific branches to specific environments

## CI Providers
- Travis CI
- Circle CI
- CodeShip
- Solano Labs
- Jenkins
    - Java
    - Open Source
    - Extensible

## Jenkins
- Jenkins is an open source pluggable build workflow manager with a web UI
- Plugins and a public plugin repository allow Jenkins to be integrated with many services
- Projects are configured in workflow stages:
    - Source Control
    - Build Steps
    - Post Build Steps
- Each stage of the workflow can impact the next step( e.g. on failure )
- Project can be configured to trigger each other
- The web UI shows a dashboard that can visualize build status, as well as test results

## Jenkins Plugins
- Jenkins plugins allow you to write custom source control integrations, build steps or post build steps
- Plugin developers are also able to integrate witht he web UI to provide options for users
- Plugins needed for our exercises:
    - Default Plugins
    - Install RVM plugin
    - Install NVM Wrapper plugin

## Jenkins - Source Control
- Jenkins can integrate with many difference source control systems
- Traditional soruce controll system would just poll on a regular basis
- Github uses web hooks (https requests )
- Jenkins Github plugin can support github webhooks
- Can be configured to only run on certain branches

## Build Steps
- Build steps are steps in the workflow
- These steps will be things like:
    - Run Tests
    - Build Production Assets
    - Publish Assets to S3
    - Deploy via Opsworks
- We will use the "bash script" build step
- Although we could write our own Jenkins plugins to do each of these steps

## Post Build Steps
- The post build stage of the workflow
- These are activities that are not considered crucial to the build process
- Examples include:
    - Source Control triggering ( build status )
    - Test Results publishing
    - Notifying developers
