# Processes
## OS
- Multiple processes to run "simultaneously"
    - Context Switching
- Processes restricted based on permissions "chmod 777"
- Allow these processes to share resources:
    - Time
    - RAM(memory) with "colliding"
    - Hard drive access, according to user permissions
    - Network usage - Ports
    - Other devices

## CPU Cycle
- fetch-decode-cycle

## Single Process
- `PID` - process ID
- Depends on language interpreted(python/ruby) or compiled(C++/Java)
- C more memory management. Allocating and deallocating => mallac to interact with system resources
- `sys calls` to interact with OS

## As A Tree
```
    $ sudo ps aux
    $ brew install pstree
    $ pstree
```

## Interaction
- System calls to access resources
- ENV are static over process lifetime
- Stdin, Stdout, Stderr use to accept inputs from keyboard, and write out text to screen
- Signals to ping resources
- piping processes `<command 1> | <comannd 2>`
- Signals
    - interrupts current process

# Networking
- socket.h -> libaray to access ports in C

## Sockets
- `OSI Stack` - Common Internet Stack
- process[#] -> OS(sockets/sys) ->  Network(IP)
- Each process can open 1 or more ports
- Ports determine which process will receive an inbound packet.
- Ports are either TCP or UDP
    - TCP: stateful, reliable
    - UDP: no retransmission of packets
- Each mac book has an IP and hardcoded Mac address
- Any connected device has an IP Address

## IP Routing
- IP addresses have proximal locations
- NAT - Network Address Traversal

# Production Stacks

## DNS
